# MVST. assignment - Github Repos

In order to run this project please add to .env.local a variable REACT_APP_GIHUB_TOKEN with a valid github token.
This token will be used to authorize your github requests.

I published it to https://github-repos-rho.vercel.app/ so if you don't want to run this locally you can check it there.
